### So What is Rice / Ricing?

> The term ‘rice’ is used to describe a person’s unix deskton where ‘ricing’ is when someone is custom their desktop such as the icons, panels, or system interface. When it comes to ricing a tiling window manager though, the ricing of a user’s system becomes much more involved. Basic things such as the panel bar and application launcher must be configured by the user.

See the basics of ricing [here](https://jie-fang.github.io/blog/basics-of-ricing).
